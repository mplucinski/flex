This is fork of flex, the fast lexical analyzer generator.

It is suggested to use official, stable version of flex unless you need features that are specific to this fork (probably Unicode support). Please consider it as alpha quality software!


flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize
lexical patterns in text.

More information about flex as well as the latest official release of
flex can be found at:

http://flex.sourceforge.net/


This fork introduces a few changes in flex. The major one is added full support of Unicode. Now, ".l" files can contain UTF-8 characters, and generated scanners are able to properly handle input in this encoding.

Other change is replacing autotools by CMake, which is much easier to maintain.




This file is part of flex.
